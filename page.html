                I've been very priviledged in my life to travel to over twenty countries. For the past seven years
                I had the wonderful priviledge of living in the UK. Along with learning how to land a sarcastic zinger
                better than a local, I also found a love for football (or what we call stateside, soccer), learned how 
                to make a proper cup of tea, and made friends from the world over. If you couldn't tell already, I didn't
                want to leave, but atlas, that is life. The beauty that is the countryside in England is arguably unmatched. 
                I spent most of the seven years wondering in forests, getting lost kayaking lochs in Scotland, and putting
                back a pint with the best of them. England is and will always be my home away from home and the selected
                family I had to leave behind will always be with me in my heart. I'm grateful for the adventures I was able 
                to go on, the friends who became family, and all the experiences that helped me become the woman I am today. 
                <br><br>
                Funny story, that is too long to include in the fun fact bit, I started my sleeve on my left arm before I 
                knew I had to move back to the states. At this point I have a sleeve that lining is nearly all the way done,
                and shading that's half-way done for the lining. I sat three, seven hour days, back-to-back, to try and get 
                it done before I came home, but alas, I will have to return in early 2023 to sit another three, seven hour days,
                back-to-back to complete it. Don't cry for me, I have a higher pain tolerance than most and was very lucky to 
                snag appointments with my artist. I'm thinking of getting my right arm fully sleeved, but I'll wait until my left
                is done before I try and find someone. I may hold off though because my two to five year plan is to move back to 
                Europe.

            <h1 style="font-size:22px;">Why I Want To Be A Software Engineer</h1>
            <p>
                There are several different reasons on why I want to become a software engineer. Let's start
                off with the practical and obvious: job secuity and the salary you can earn in comparison to cost 
                of living. As someone who used to work in tech in England, I understand the pressures that can be
                placed on you, but also know the benefit of the salary that you are compensationed with for that 
                stress. So, in a very practical way, you can say, I want to become an software engineer because I 
                don't want to have roommates or be in a relationship just to make rent cheaper ðŸ˜‚. I think the saying
                goes, "In this economy...," if you have the ability to learn and be good at it, why wouldn't you?!
                <br>
                <br>
                On a less practical, we live in a capitalist death-trap, money makes the world go round society, 
                I like problem solving. I also believe in working with your strengths and being someone who's brain
                likes to brake down things to the smallest steps to find out why and how things work, I felt that 
                software engineering would be a great fit to feed that part of my brain. I also like to spot the 
                smallest of errors, it's something that my brain does well, and I am hopeful will lend to my strengths
                in the back-end. I have a brother and several friends who are a software engineers and they've been telling
                me for years now, that I just needed to bite the bullet and do it, so here I am. Finally believing in my 
                potential the way those around me do. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Have friends and family already in the industry has also helped to set realistic expectation of the stress
                load of the job. There is a reason the perks look as good as they do. Have this well-balaced out look going 
                into the course, I think will only lend itself to me. I'm ready to work my butt off and change my life for 
                the better on the otherside. One last reason I want to become an engineer is becuase of the doors and opportunies
                it will open for me.

                    The photos above are of the life size statues of Gundam and Bumblee, where Gundam stands 19.7 meters tall.
                    The photo was taken in Shibya, Japan on my brother and I's annual brother/sister trip. The second photo is 
                    when I flew home to Denver from the UK to see Taylor Swift in concert for her Reputation Stadium tour. And
                    the final photo is Manchester City playing Paris Saint Germain in the Champions League Semi-Final.
